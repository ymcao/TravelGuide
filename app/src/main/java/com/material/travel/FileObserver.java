/**
 * Monitors files (using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify">inotify</a>)
 * to fire an event after files are accessed or changed by by any process on
 * the device (including this one).  FileObserver is an abstract class;
 * subclasses must implement the event handler {@link #onEvent(int, String)}.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Each FileObserver instance monitors a single file or directory.
 * If a directory is monitored, events will be triggered for all files and
 * subdirectories inside the monitored directory.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>An event mask is used to specify which changes or actions to report.
 * Event type constants are used to describe the possible changes in the
 * event mask as well as what actually happened in event callbacks.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p class="caution"><b>Warning</b>: If a FileObserver is garbage collected, it
 * will stop sending events.  To ensure you keep receiving events, you must
 * keep a reference to the FileObserver instance from some other live object.</p>
